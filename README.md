# GAN-Texture-Synthesis

This is our final project for CS2831. We aim to implement a rudimentary version of the algorith from "Learning Texture Manifolds with the Periodic Spatial GAN‚Äù by Bergmann et al., 2017, and to extend the implementation to include additional parameters \alpha that can accommodate perspective distortion that is caused when a planar texture sample is observed from a non-frontal view.

Paths to take: Can apply a homography in cv2,
